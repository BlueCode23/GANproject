The goal of this repo is to make a GAN that generates images

I will use pytorch for that extent and make a jupyter notebook for ease of demonstration

Generator : 
This Neural Network produces fake data whose goal is to be as close to real data as possible.
It tries to trick the discriminator into concluding this data is real.

Discriminator:
This Neural Network inspects the data and tries to determine if it is fake or real.

Both are trained simulaneously by limiting their respective losses and using Binary Cross Enthropy.
